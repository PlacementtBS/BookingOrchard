        <h1>Empowering Efficiency in Venue Hire</h1>
        <h3>Welcome to bookingorchard, a platform designed to provide flexibility in the management of bookings. Unlike other systems on the market we cater for different business structures, booking processes and financial management of both purpose built and secondary venture venues. While other solutions provide a one click fix that solves part of the problem and requires you to make up for the deficit with handmade rotas or planning, we provide tools to automate planning documentation and bring front line workers in your venue the information fresh from the source.</h3>

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h3>Whilst working as a theatre technician with admin support duties in a secondary school, our co-founder Ben experienced a number of problems with both on the market solutions and workaround procedures. The problem, paper systems couldn't hold up to fast paced periods in the calendar, leading to disruption and reduced quality of service for his venue.<br><br> Off the shelf fixes didn't work for his venue as each one had a unique set of setbacks that disqualified the solution from working. Whether it was tied finances with the venues sports facilities or client self service only, no single product provided the flexibility to shape the system around their process rather than the process around the system.<br><br> Enter bookingorchard, the idea to create a flexible system that solved the common problems whislt maintaining the technological benefits they shared.</h3>
